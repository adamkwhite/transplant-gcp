**Total:** 0/103 subtasks completed

## Key Milestones

- [ ] Phase 1: ADK Setup & Agent Scaffolding (Nov 4-5) - 2 days
- [ ] Phase 2: Agent Implementation (Nov 6-8) - 3 days
- [ ] Phase 3: Multi-Agent Communication (Nov 8) - 1 day
- [ ] Phase 4: Deployment & Integration (Nov 9) - 1 day
- [ ] Phase 5: Documentation & Demo (Nov 10) - 1 day

## Architecture Components

**4 ADK Agents to Implement:**
1. Coordinator Agent - Routes patient requests to specialists
2. Medication Advisor Agent - Handles missed dose analysis
3. Symptom Monitor Agent - Assesses rejection risk from symptoms
4. Drug Interaction Checker Agent - Analyzes medication interactions

**Deployment Target:** 4 separate Cloud Run services

## Next Steps

1. **START HERE**: Begin Task 0.0: Repository Setup with Best Practices
   - Configure pre-commit hooks (Ruff, mypy, bandit, safety)
   - Set up pyproject.toml, Makefile, GitHub Actions workflows
   - Update .gitignore with ADK/Cloud Run specific patterns
   - Verify all tooling works before implementing features
2. Then proceed to Task 1.0: Set Up ADK Framework and Dependencies
3. Review PRD and tasks.md for detailed implementation plan

## Known Issues / Blockers

None yet - implementation has not started.
