### 🎯 Features & Agent Capabilities

**Multi-Agent AI System** powered by Google ADK with 5 specialized agents:

1. **TransplantCoordinator Agent** (Orchestrator)
   - Analyzes patient requests to identify needed specialists
   - Routes to appropriate agents (medication, symptom, interaction, rejection)
   - Synthesizes multi-agent responses into comprehensive guidance
   - Coordinates parallel consultations when multiple concerns present

2. **MedicationAdvisor Agent** (Specialist)
   - Analyzes missed immunosuppressant doses (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.)
   - Provides timing-based guidance (take now vs. skip vs. half-dose)
   - Calculates medication adherence scores
   - Recommends next-dose timing to maintain therapeutic levels

3. **SymptomMonitor Agent** (Specialist)
   - Assesses rejection risk from patient-reported symptoms
   - Evaluates severity (fever, pain, fatigue, swelling)
   - Provides urgency ratings (immediate ER vs. call doctor vs. monitor)
   - Generates monitoring protocols for ongoing symptoms

4. **DrugInteraction Agent** (Specialist)
   - Checks drug-drug interactions for immunosuppressants
   - Analyzes food-drug interactions (grapefruit, St. John's wort, etc.)
   - Reviews supplement compatibility
   - Provides safety warnings and alternative recommendations

5. **RejectionRisk Agent** (Specialist)
   - Evidence-based rejection risk analysis using SRTR transplant outcomes data
   - Population-level statistical comparisons
   - Real transplant registry data (kidney, liver, heart, lung)
   - Risk assessment based on time post-transplant and symptoms

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Real AI inference using Gemini 2.0 Flash (not mock data!)
- ✅ Intelligent multi-agent routing and coordination
- ✅ Evidence-based recommendations from SRTR transplant registry
- ✅ Patient history tracking in Firestore
- ✅ Production-ready error handling and monitoring

### 🏥 The Problem We're Solving

**Transplant patients face life-threatening medication challenges:**
- 50-60% of transplant failures occur due to medication non-adherence
- Patients must take immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) exactly on schedule
- Missing or delaying doses can trigger organ rejection
- Patients often don't know whether to take a late dose or skip it
- Symptom evaluation requires specialist knowledge to assess rejection risk
- Drug interactions with food, supplements, and other medications are complex

**Our Solution:**
An AI-powered multi-agent system that provides instant, expert-level guidance on:
- Missed dose timing decisions (with evidence from medical protocols)
- Rejection risk assessment from symptoms (using SRTR transplant registry data)
- Drug interaction safety checks (preventing dangerous combinations)
- 24/7 availability when patients can't reach their transplant team

### 🚀 Quick Deploy

1. **Get Gemini API Key** (Free):
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy the key

2. **Deploy to Cloud Run** (with ADK Multi-Agent System):
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   The deployment script will:
   - Copy ADK agents and config to the service directory
   - Build Docker container with Python 3.12 and google-adk
   - Deploy to Cloud Run with 1GB memory (for 4 ADK agents)
   - Configure 2 CPUs for optimal agent performance

3. **Add Gemini API Key**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update missed-dose-service \
     --set-env-vars GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here \
     --region=us-central1
   ```

   **Note:** The service requires GEMINI_API_KEY to initialize all 4 ADK agents.

### 🧪 Test Endpoints

**Live Service**: https://missed-dose-service-64rz4skmdq-uc.a.run.app

Try these endpoints with the live deployment:

```bash
# Health check (verify all ADK agents are running)
curl https://missed-dose-service-64rz4skmdq-uc.a.run.app/health
# Expected: Shows "Google ADK Multi-Agent System" with 5 active agents

# Missed dose analysis (MedicationAdvisorAgent)
curl -X POST https://missed-dose-service-64rz4skmdq-uc.a.run.app/medications/missed-dose \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "medication": "tacrolimus",
    "scheduled_time": "8:00 AM",
    "current_time": "2:00 PM",
    "patient_id": "test_patient"
  }'
# Expected: Timing-based guidance from AI specialist

# Rejection risk analysis (RejectionRiskAgent with SRTR data)
curl -X POST https://missed-dose-service-64rz4skmdq-uc.a.run.app/rejection/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "patient_id": "test_patient",
    "organ_type": "kidney",
    "symptoms": ["fever", "fatigue", "decreased_urine_output"],
    "days_post_transplant": 90
  }'
# Expected: Evidence-based risk assessment using transplant outcomes data
```

**Multi-Agent Coordination Example:**
A patient query like "I missed my 8am tacrolimus dose, it's now 2pm, and I have a fever" triggers:
1. TransplantCoordinator analyzes the request
2. Routes to MedicationAdvisor (missed dose) + SymptomMonitor (fever)
3. Both agents consult Gemini 2.0 Flash in parallel
4. Coordinator synthesizes comprehensive response
5. Response time: ~2-3 seconds for multi-agent consultation
